# DAOflex

**DAOHacks Hackathon - March 18-30, 2022**


### Description
DAOflex is the new way of boosting DAO collaboration and engagement. Get paid for contributions and pay back for your membership.

**Github**: https://github.com/FiveElementsLabs/daoflex

### How it's made

DAOflex uses Superfluid to create two DAO token payment streams.
The first Superfluid Constant Flow Agreement is paid by the DAO member to the DAO as a membership subscription.
The second Superfluid Instant Distribution Agreement is paid by the DAO to the member after completing an action that triggers a reward.

Unlock is used to create content locks that are accessible only by the top contributors.
